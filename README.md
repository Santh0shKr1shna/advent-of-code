# Advent Of Code - 2024 (solutions)

My attempt to solve AOC-24 everyday puzzles. Every solution is accompanied by tests in their respective dirs. I have written simple tests to check logic with sample input given in the puzzle itself.

Refer the og website for more info, [Click Here](https://adventofcode.com/2024/)

To run any programs, just run the `main.py`:
```
python3 main.py
```

### Todo
- [ ] Add utils scripts to auto fetch full inputs for each puzzle
- [ ] Full coverage tests
- [ ] Add parser to run specialised cases
